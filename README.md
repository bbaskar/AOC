This repository contains solutions solved in C# programming language for the puzzles from the "Advent of Code".

The solution contains a console application which contains day-wise directory structure having both the **sourcecode** and **input files** as defined in [Advent Calendar ](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

To execute each day wise solution pass the value of the **_respective day_** as a [command-line arguments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/main-command-line) to the console application. The application takes one argument at run time, converts the argument to an integer, and executes the respective day-wise puzzle.
